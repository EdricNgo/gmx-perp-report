**GMX vs. Perp Protocol:**

**A Comparison of #2 Decentralized Perpetual Exchanges**

**Dashboard: [https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/increment/pages/edric-inc/gmx-margin/](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/increment/pages/edric-inc/gmx-margin/), [https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/increment/pages/edric-inc/perpetual-protocol/](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/increment/pages/edric-inc/perpetual-protocol/)**

**Introduction**

- In the financial system, a perpetual futures contract, also known as a perpetual swap, represents an agreement to buy or sell an asset at an unspecified point in the future. It also allows users to trade using margin or leverage (using borrowed funds).
- GMX is a decentralized platform for spot and perpetual contract trading that supports users to leverage up to 30x on their trades. The protocol launched on Arbitrum in September 2021 and then went into Avalanche at the beginning of 2022.
- Perpetual Protocol is an on-chain perpetual futures DEX with deep liquidity and builder-ready composability on Optimism.
- The fast-growing decentralized derive space has a lot of competition. For example, 90%+ of the current volume is from the DYDX exchange, with Perp protocol and GMX exchange battling for #2.

- Both exchanges have had nearly similar monthly user counts since the start of 2022.
- But in May, GMX's overall active user base multiplied by 10 (about 19k users) as opposed to Perp's (around 2k2 users). Following then, Perp's real active users increased to 22k5 users in October 2022.
- Both have a roughly equal number of users ( 10,000) up to this point.
- In comparison to the Perp Protocol, the total number of events (close/open position) for GMX is just about 1/10. On GMX, a user only attends 7 to 18 events on average each month, whereas Perp attended 450 events in April to reach ATH.

- GMX Monthly Active Users (MAU) increased by three times in June and then remained constant at about 10k MAU.
- Early and mid-2022 will see a consistent MAU of about 2k–3k for Perp Protocol. But in Oct, it overtook the GMX when the MAU increased threefold in September and twice in October.
- GMX has a stickiness ratio (Avg DAU/MAU) of 12–15% while Perp merely has a stickiness ratio (Avg DAU/MAU) of 10%–12%. This year, both exchanges are expanding quite swiftly.

- A highly outstanding amount for a DEX, GMX's monthly volume maintains stability at roughly $5.5B and reaches ATH in Sep at $9.3B.
- Since the beginning of the year, Perp's monthly volume has decreased rather significantly; even though MAU increased in October, the volume for that month was only about $500M (or 1/10 GMX).
- Both exchanges have the highest percentage of market volumes in the BTC, ETH, and Avax markets when comparing market volumes. The most actively traded market on both exchanges is ETH.
- Similar to the volume, the overall fee for Perp has significantly decreased. In Oct., it's only $495k as opposed to 1.5M$ in Jan.
- The average monthly Fee volume for GMX remains constant at $5M.

**General Remarks**

- With large volume, liquidity, and active users, Perp Protocol and GMX Exchange are the most well-known participants in the DEX perpetual markets vertical. In contrast to Perp, GMX is rising significantly faster.
